# Hierarchical Clustering

[Hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) is a hierarchical method that creates a clustering tree called a dendrogram. Each leaf on the tree is a data point, and branches represent the joining of clusters. We can 'cut' the tree at different heights to get a different number of clusters. This method does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance and can be either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).

```
## Example
```@example 1
using PhyloClustering, PhyloNetworks

# read trees with 4-taxa in Newick format using PhyloNetworks
trees = readMultiTopology("../data/data.trees");

# convert trees to Bipartition foramt and embed them via split-weight embedding
trees = split_weight(trees, 4);
```

Standardize the data, calculate the distance matrix, and input them into Yinyang K-means clustering.

```@example 1
tree = standardize_tree(trees);
matrix = distance(tree);
label = hc_label(matrix, 2)
```
